# GraphQL Tools

This repo will eventually contain a suite of tools for working with GraphQL schemas and queries.

## Goals

The goal is to include the following:

- Validation of a schema
- Validation of queries against a schema
- Formatting of schemas and queries

## Development

Currently development happens against the beta version of Rust. Once the 2018 edition is released we'll move to stable.

To use to the beta toolchain run `rustup override set beta` while in this folder.
